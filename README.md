### MmembRAN

A 2D logical strategy game in the microworld. Made in 4 days with plain javascript.
All art and music made by me on the game jam.

(That file jamjs.js was a small preparation for the jam. Feel free to use it when you start a new javascript game.)

## How to run

Download the files.
Unzip the folder.
Double click at the index.html.
